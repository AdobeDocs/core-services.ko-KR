**Fixes** 

* Fixed an issue preventing single sign-on between the [!DNL Experience Cloud] and [!DNL Advertising Cloud].

**Known Issues** 

* Linking and unlinking your dynamic tag management organization with Experience Cloud is not working for newly created Experience Cloud organizations. Adobe is working to fix this and restore normal functionality with the May release. If you experience problems when trying to single-sign on into dynamic tag management via Experience Cloud, use the legacy login at `dtm.adobe.com`.
* A known issue is preventing audience sharing from report suites which are not owned by the linked Analytics account. Remedial efforts are underway
